 abstract = {Some of the most important phenomena in international conflict are coded as "rare events": binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer events, such as wars and coups, than "nonevents." Unfortunately, rare events data are difficult to explain and predict, a problem stemming from at least two sources. First, and most important, the data-collection strategies used in international conflict studies are grossly inefficient. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (wars, for example) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99 percent of their (nonfixed) data-collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. Second, logistic regression, and other commonly used statistical procedures, can underestimate the probability of rare events. We introduce some corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. We also provide easy-to-use methods and software that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously.},

 abstract = {International relations research has regarded networks as a particular mode of organization, distinguished from markets or state hierarchies. In contrast, network analysis permits the investigation and measurement of network structures—emergent properties of persistent patterns of relations among agents that can define, enable, and constrain those agents. Network analysis offers both a toolkit for identifying and measuring the structural properties of networks and a set of theories, typically drawn from contexts outside international relations, that relate structures to outcomes. Network analysis challenges conventional views of power in international relations by defining network power in three different ways: access, brokerage, and exit options. Two issues are particularly important to international relations: the ability of actors to increase their power by enhancing and exploiting their network positions, and the fungibility of network power. The value of network analysis in international relations has been demonstrated in precise description of international networks, investigation of network effects on key international outcomes, testing of existing network theory in the context of international relations, and development of new sources of data. Partial or faulty incorporation of network analysis, however, risks trivial conclusions, unproven assertions, and measures without meaning. A three-part agenda is proposed for future application of network analysis to international relations: import the toolkit to deepen research on international networks; test existing network theories in the domain of international relations; and test international relations theories using the tools of network analysis.},

  abstract = {Energy security remains a vital issue for the European Union (EU), even more so in the wake of the events that unfolded in early 2014 in Ukraine. The EU's already fragile position in the international energy arena in terms of security of supply appears to be more uncertain than ever after its umpteenth fallout with its historic energy supplier, Russia. This situation is untenable and calls for swift and decisive action to adequately tackle the issue once and for all. The article looks at the creation of a single EU energy market through the integration of energy networks in the EU. This article then examines various ways to diversify its energy supply, whether through increasing the import of liquefied natural gas or through its relations with the Eurasian Union. It then explores the International Energy Charter as an example of the EU's engagement with transnational policy networks. It concludes that from energy transit, to technology transfer, to investment protection, energy and trade present interplays across various fields. Improvements can be made to the EU trading system to ensure greater energy security and more efficient energy markets.},

year = {2015},
doi = {10.1177/0309132514566343},
abstract ={This paper takes stock of geographical contributions to the study of energy and energy futures. The paper is written in two parts. First, I trace the methodological and philosophical traditions that underpin geographical approaches to energy studies. I argue that while ‘energy geography’ is arguably a pragmatic shorthand with which to communicate to the broader energy studies community, geographical studies of energy have expanded in scope and theoretical plurality so that ‘energy geographies’ is a more appropriate label. Energy geographers are well positioned to contribute to scientific and policy debates surrounding energy due to their privileged position at the borderland between various philosophical and methodological traditions. Second, I identify some of the problems, opportunities and uncertainties that contemporary energy geographers are helping to identify, understand, and resolve. Past contributions and critical issues for future scholarship are highlighted in four themes: (1) using advanced socio-spatial theory to better understand the energy-society relationship; (2) geo-political and geo-economic assessments of (changing) global energy trade networks; (3) geographical perspectives on socio-technical (energy) transitions; and (4) advanced spatial decision-support for energy planning and technology implementation. While this discussion is by no means exhaustive, it aims to bring some clarity and specificity to the policy and academic relevance of geographical thought and practice as it relates to energy issues.},

doi = {10.1093/reep/reu016},
abstract ={Natural gas plays an important role in the global energy system as an input to power generation, heating, and industry. This article identifies key drivers and uncertainties for natural gas markets in the coming decades. These include the availability of natural gas from conventional and unconventional sources, the role of international trade, and the impact of climate policies. We build on model-based research as well as an up-to-date survey of natural gas resource availability. We find that natural gas is an abundant fossil fuel and that the Asia-Pacific region will be most important in future global natural gas markets, especially under stringent international climate change mitigation. This means that an increasingly large share of future natural gas trade flows and infrastructure expansions will be directed to the Asia-Pacific region and that the role of liquefied natural gas will continue to increase globally.

Overall, prospective Russian actions and policies have profound implications for the development of the European gas market in general, and thus for potential US LNG exports to Europe.Moreover, underlying all this is the most worrisome question of all: do Russia’s policies and actions enable gas consumers—and indeed, some Central Asian gas producers—to regard Russia as a reliable energy partner?This article therefore addresses:
Prospects for the full implementation of the Russia–China gas accords;Prospects for Turkmen gas supply to both Russia and China;Prospects for the development of both Gazprom’s Turkish Stream project and the EU-backed Southern Gas Corridor;Prospects for US LNG in Europe;The potential challenge that a change in Russian gas export policies could pose to European gas prices.The article also seeks to answer the question as to whether Russia can be considered a reliable partner, particularly in connection with long-term deliveries to Europe.},

Russia's alternative vision encompasses multipolarity, financial nationalism and political illiberalism. These policies are symbiotic. The state uses its control over financial flows to build and maintain political and economic power at home as well as to project its influence abroad, all justified with a strong dose of great power nationalism positioning Russia as the Eurasian pole in an emerging multipolar world order. However, the Kremlin is doomed to frustration in its quest to assert international economic leadership. The Russian government has the ability to shake up the existing international order but lacks the credibility, stability, or economic clout to lead the creation of a new one. This has troubling implications for the future of international economic cooperation and reform, as Russia's frustrations have increasingly turned it in reactive and confrontational directions.},

Russia holds a key but vulnerable strategic position in the heartland of Eurasia. Its geographical existence within a larger zone of Eurasian civilization meant that Russian culture had been shaped to a not insignificant extent by influences coming from Asia, that Russia was Eurasian and not European not only by virtue of its cultural patterns but also in terms of anthropological–racial considerations as well. The Eurasian Customs Union is clearly seen by Russia as a vehicle for reintegrating the post-Soviet space, including the countries that fall within the sphere of the European Union's (EU)'s eastern neighbourhood.The Eurasian Customs Union is the vehicle through which Russia increasingly engages in ‘normative rivalry’ with the EU in the so-called ‘shared neighbourhood’. These geopolitical and economic contraptions underpin the strategic calculations that have influenced largely the crisis of Russian Lebensraum escapade in Ukraine and EU's reaction.

  abstract = {Abstract The enactment of the Energy Concept by the German Government in 2010 set ambitious targets for the future energy transition in Germany. The most prominent goals include a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction of the economy and an increase in the share of renewable energy in the whole energy sector. Since the long run effects of these policy measures are hard to assess, science-based policy evaluation methods are needed to identify weak points and areas with a need for action. This paper presents the results of the German Energy Reference Forecast with a focus on the electricity sector. It is based on an investment and dispatch model for the European electricity sector over the planning horizon of the ‘Energiewende’ up to 2050, with an emphasis on the time period up to 2030. We find that almost all targets of the German ‘Energiewende’ are not reached, for the case in which no further measures are undertaken. In particular reductions in \{GHG\} emissions fall short to the target value. Contrary to the negative results, e.g., regarding GHG-emissions as well as gross electricity consumption, generation from renewable energy sources will exceed the policy's target value.},

abstract ={There are many options for generating electricity with low carbon emissions, and the electrification of heat and transport can decarbonize energy use across the economy. This places the power sector at the forefront of any move away from fossil fuels, even though fossil-fuelled generators are more dependable and flexible than nuclear reactors or intermittent renewables, and vital for the second-by-second balancing of supply and demand. Renewables tend to supplement, rather than replace, fossil capacity, although output from fossil-fuelled stations will fall and some will have to retire to avoid depressing wholesale power prices. At times of low demand and high renewable output prices can turn negative, but electricity storage, long-distance interconnection, and flexible demand may develop to absorb any excess generation. Simulations for Great Britain show that while coal may be eliminated from the mix within a decade, natural gas has a long-term role in stations with or without carbon capture and storage, depending on its cost and the price of carbon.},

However, the EU-Russia gas trade currently faces uncertainty over the regular transit of Russian gas via Ukraine, the construction of new pipelines and the implementation of EU legislation concerning the Union's gas market. As the EU and Russia will remain interdependent in the gas sector at least for the next decade, it is in both sides' interest to resolve these issues. The EU should both strengthen the security of its import routes for Russian gas and reduce the vulnerability of individual member states to supply shocks. Simultaneously, the EU would do well to increase the production of renewable energy and boost energy efficiency, which would reduce its dependence on external suppliers of fossil fuels.},

It argues that Russian foreign policy towards Ukraine results from a combination of two trends, reinforcing a Russian interventionist agenda: perceived threats to Russia’s interests in the near abroad and a radicalised and conservative national spectrum shaping foreign policy decisions. The combination of domestic and external factors driving Russia’s agenda in the near abroad raises important challenges for Russian society and its leaders as it does for its neighbours and partners.},

  abstract = {The research of Eurasian regionalism mostly focuses on the Eurasian core, for example, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, which have been pursuing a more exclusive and closer form of integration – Customs Union/Eurasian Economic Union. Other countries of the post-Soviet space are often described as post-Soviet ‘escapists’ or ‘isolationists’ and mostly discounted in the analyses of the Eurasian regionalism. The paper looks at six post-Soviet states, who opted out from the Eurasian Economic Union, and analyse their interaction with the EEU. The paper argues that despite tensions in relations with Russia, most of these countries are reluctant to entirely disrupt their economic relations with the post-Soviet Eurasia. The paper argues that six countries of the post-Soviet Eurasian periphery effectively pursue policies of a looser form association with the Eurasian core. This finding allows to argue that Eurasian regionalism, similarly to its European model, consists of the core and outer circle. The outer circle is featured by overlapping regional arrangements and growing presence of external powers and growing number of transit and trade flows linking this Eurasian periphery with the West and Asia.},

abstract = {Geopolitics and geoeconomics are often addressed together, with the latter seen as a sub-variant of the former. This article shows the usefulness of differentiating them at a conceptual level. By juxtaposing traditional geopolitics and geoeconomics, we suggest that they have remarkably different qualities and implications for their targets, on both national and international levels. Importantly, these include the formation of alliances, and whether they are driven by balancing, bandwagoning or underbalancing dynamics. An analysis of Russia's shifting geostrategy towards Europe shows these differences in practice. Russian geoeconomics has long been successful as a ‘wedge strategy’, dividing the EU. As a result, the EU has underbalanced and its Russia policies have been incoherent. The observable tendencies in 2014–15 towards a more coherent European approach can be explained by the changing emphasis in Russia's geostrategy. Russia's turn to geopolitics works as a centripetal force, causing a relative increase in EU unity. Centripetal tendencies due to heightened threat perception can be observed in the economic sanctions, emerging German leadership in EU foreign policy, and discussion on energy union. The analysis calls for more attention to the way strategic choices—geopolitics versus geoeconomics—affect the coherence of threatened states and alliance patterns.},

Conflict has arisen as the status seeking efforts of the two have been transformed into a dangerous zero-sum game. Moscow’s actions in Ukraine prompted the EU to adopt a more conflictual attitude, where it now actively aims to counteract Moscow’s influence. This transformed Russia and the EU’s status seeking efforts into a deep security dilemma. Both actors perceive that maintaining their influence in the region is crucial for maintaining their status. Rather than seeking a mutually and sustainable agreement that would give equal importance to Ukraine’s interests, the EU and Russia draw more red lines, and revert to cold war rhetoric. In the short term this behaviour will put their status seeking efforts even more at odds with each other and deepen the conflict.},

  abstract = {Abstract Until now, the complex relationship between energy security and climate change has been addressed using a partial understanding of security, one that is based on simplified indicators such as import dependence or fuel mix diversity. As a consequence, the synergies and trade-offs between climate change and energy security policies have not been systematically explored according to a wider understanding of the latter concept. The purpose of this article is to resolve the resulting knowledge gap by proposing a theoretical approach to energy security that is consistent with its multi-dimensional nature, taking into account the whole energy supply chain. Five key ‘systemic’ properties of energy security will be identified – namely, stability, flexibility, adequacy, resilience and robustness. The paper proposes a novel framework to assess energy security and uses this framework to develop a comprehensive approach to the interactions between climate change policies and energy security. The impact of a low-carbon scenario on one of these five properties (long-term robustness) will be assessed using a complex multi-regional energy system model. The results demonstrate how this scenario induces structural changes along the whole energy supply chain, revealing dynamic vulnerabilities and trade-offs that are not adequately accounted for by existing indicator-based assessments. Finally, the paper provides solid foundations for further analysis of these trade-offs using more detailed sectoral models.},

More open and careful discussions are needed concerning the various risks and uncertainties of future energy options, both in Japan and globally. In this paper, we aim to offer a fundamental basis for discourse on energy security by analyzing the status and trends in academic publications on that issue. Our bibliometrics analysis indicates that research has shifted from promoting strategies for ensuring the self-sufficiency of the primary energy to diversification of the secondary energy supply chain by introducing energy networks consisting of an infrastructure established through international coordination. In the literature, the concept of energy security is ambiguous and allows for multiple interpretations. Our results illustrate the existence of highly multidisciplinary topics within energy security, which can be categorized into four perspectives: geopolitical, economic, policy related, and technological.},

This is the context in which energy security has risen high on the policy agenda of governments around the world and the term ‘energy security’ has quietly slipped into the energy lexicon. The limited discourse about the nature of the term or its underlying assumptions has been totally eclipsed by an almost overwhelming focus on securing supplies of primary energy sources and geopolitics. An examination of explicit and inferred definitions finds that the concept of energy security is inherently slippery because it is polysemic in nature, capable of holding multiple dimensions and taking on different specificities depending on the country (or continent), timeframe or energy source to which it is applied. This ‘slipperiness’ poses analytical, prediction and policy difficulties but if explicitly recognised through definitional clarity, new levels of understanding will enrich the policy debate to deal with obstacles impacting on the constantly evolving nature of energy security.},

While much of the current literature posits an either/or approach (China adapts to energy market or tries to redefine them as a part of a wider political plan), our hypothesis is that China is essentially a pragmatic actor who reacts to the forces in presence, rather than a revisionist power with a grand plan to realign the world order to suit its needs and satisfy some kind of pre-established grand vision. We posit that China goes beyond conformity with or resistance to the established energy market and the power relations they underpin: While local circumstances may be considered variables, its fixed objective is a stable international order and the pragmatic satisfaction of its energy needs in order to insure continued economic growth and general stability at home.",

In parallel, important changes in geopolitical, environmental and technological determinants can be observed in the European and global energy and gas markets. These changes have been highly influential in generating `reactive' policies in the European Union, both in Brussels as well as in the Member States. The evolution of the European natural gas policy creating a strongly regulated version of a `well-functioning' gas market remains a highly politicized and instable experiment. The values attached to natural gas are constantly shifting between the economics, to security of supply and sustainability. Moreover, the importance attached to these values and their operationalization are different in the various parts of Europe. Therewith, the creation of `well-functioning' EU gas market will always remain a politicized and never ending story.",

abstract="Recent technology innovation in the natural gas industry has powered a shale gas boom, enabling the narrative that natural gas is a transition fuel to a low-carbon future. However, this narrative has not manifested itself uniformly around the world and, more fundamentally, it must be tested and revised periodically to reflect rapidly changing market, supply chain, and environmental realities. The growth in production has put downward pressure on prices, incentivized increased consumption and trade in the coming years, leading to the coming of age of the global market for liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG from areas with high levels of production can increasingly respond to demand growth elsewhere; however, questions about infrastructure availability, competition with other energy sources, and end use blur our understanding about environmental outcomes. New markets for natural gas face new medium and long-term challenges through capital investments in long-term infrastructure which creates a risk of displacing lower carbon options and prolonging higher emitting facilities. We explore the narrative of natural gas as a transition fuel, and how it has thus far manifested itself in various key markets. The United States is our region of focus on the supply side due to the recent shale gas boom and emission reductions from the coal-to-gas transition in the power sector. We make reference to producing regions involved in the international trade of liquefied natural gas. Questions related to demand from the European Union, OECD Asia, and parts of non-OECD Asia are discussed. China and India---representing the centers of prolific anticipated demand growth---are discussed in terms of challenges to domestic supply growth and competing environmental and political objectives.",

With the shale revolution putting peak oil concerns aside and the global rearrangement of energy consumer and producer roles, the emergence of China and India have focused attention on energy security. This paper reviews tens of dimensions, components and metrics that may be used to define energy security, and the methods that may be used to calculate an energy security index. The 4As (availability, affordability, accessibility and acceptability), the five Ss (surety, survivability, supply, sufficiency and sustainability) and other similar approaches are discussed with corresponding metrics. A concise and inclusive novel energy security index is synthesized, with seven no overlapping dimensions: physical availability, technology development, economic affordability, social accessibility, governance, unconventional threats, and natural environment. Since the dimensions of an energy security index are not perceived as having equal importance by different economic actors or the research literature, a small group of energy, economics, technology, geopolitics and environment experts was asked to rate their importance of the seven dimensions of the proposed index. Physical availability was rated as the most important, and natural environment as the least important dimension. In forthcoming research, this energy security index will be combined with the appropriate qualitative methods to reframe geopolitical problems.

Energy is an important material basis of national economy, and the future national destiny depends on the control of energy. The development and efficient use of energy and per capita consumption are important indicators of production technology and living standards. This paper analyzes the relationship between China’s energy status and One Belt And One Road security from the aspects of China’s energy status, China’s energy consumption in the next 30 years, China’s various energy basic conditions and important energy policies related to countries along the silk road. It is found that “The Belt And Road” strategy provides support and conditions for China’s energy development.}

abstract="The need to establish a common external energy policy in the EU emerges from rapid changes in the international system. Rising competition for the available resources, increasing demand for the fossil fuels in China and India, alongside the gas markets' structural changes from regional to global, means high supply security risks of existing energy imports of the EU member states. Considering these international shifts, it is therefore puzzling why until now no meaningful common external energy policy had emerged in the EU. I argue that the preferences of member states' governments are being influenced by domestic economic interest groups and geopolitical relations with the suppliers. Based on the selected country cases of Germany, Poland, France and Spain this chapter (I) analyses the process of domestic preference formation of these countries towards their main gas suppliers---Russia and Algeria; and (II) examines what role geopolitics play in this policy domain.",

Despite the enduring importance of transit to the global energy system, the topic did not begin to be extensively analyzed until contentious relations between Russia and Ukraine disrupted natural gas flows to Europe in 2006. This chapter examines the geopolitics and security of transiting gas through pipelines by exploring the connection between geography, global energy strategies, and natural gas markets. Gas has grown in recent years as a percentage of global energy consumption and is helping the world transition to a cleaner energy regime. At the same time, it is intensifying the contest for and control of gas-transit routes. Russia, the world's second-largest producer, has built new pipelines to Europe since 2006 in order to diversify its flow from relying on Ukraine, while the USA, the world's largest gas producer, is increasingly exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) through sea routes mostly controlled by the US navy. We argue that geostrategic calculations will more profoundly affect gas transit in the future and that countries that rely solely on market or commercial factors for their gas-transit security will become increasingly vulnerable to geopolitical volatility.",

abstract = "Meeting the European Union's natural gas demand will require increasing volumes of imports in the foreseeable future. Recognizing the need to ensure uninterrupted and secure supplies of natural gas imports at all times, the European Union (EU) has actively sought to diversify its sources of supply, including obtaining natural gas from Azerbaijan through the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). In pursuit of this objective, the EU has provided financial support for parts of the Southern Gas Corridor. In this paper, a combination of cost economics and Rational Choice Institutionalism (RCI) framework has been used to explain the policy choice made by the EU to support the SGC. We observe, that the choice of using the SGC as a supply source has been despite the relatively higher cost of delivery of Azeri natural gas into the EU. The motivation for the EU here is characterized by the strategic importance and part of its efforts to diversify sources of supply in the RCI framework. In this context, the EU is delivering energy security services to its member states who in turn have muted their sovereign rights in exchange for a diversity in the source of supply. This is possibly the only study that measures up the economic cost against choices made under RCI in natural gas security literature."

Moreover, indices represent effective communication tools for policymakers. This paper analyzes 63 indices quantifying the energy security performance of countries. In particular, their scope, geographical coverage, number of countries analyzed, time frame covered, number of indicators considered, data treatment approach, multivariate analysis, normalization, weighting and aggregation of the indicators, and the assessment of uncertainty, sensitivity and robustness are reviewed. Results show that there is a considerable lack of transparency, especially about the selection of the indicator set, normalization method, indicator weighting scheme and aggregation function. Furthermore, the index construction steps of data treatment and multivariate analysis are either not performed or under-reported. Finally, only few studies provide an uncertainty, sensitivity or robustness analysis, even though such an analysis has the potential to greatly improve the confidence into the results. Based on the findings of this paper, research gaps are identified and recommendations for future research provided. Even though the present analysis was conducted on energy security, the findings can be applied to indices in any field in order to support well-informed decision-making."

abstract="Energy markets are often considered among the most important topics of the global political and economic agenda due to several reasons. The first reason is their relative scope in terms of international flows of goods. Although the list of most actively traded goods varies depending on relative prices, crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas are usually on its top. For example, in 2018, crude oil was the most traded good in the global markets with {\$}1110 billion of sales, while petroleum products occupied the third place with {\$}807 billion of sales, and natural gas was on the 17th position. The second reason is the influence of energy markets on the rest of the economy through energy supplies, in other words, the dependence of other industries on the reliability and costs of energy sources. The third reason is the direct connection between the development of energy sector and the solution to important sustainability problems, including at least two challenges from the UN's list of Sustainable Development Goals: ``Affordable and clean energy'' and ``Climate action''.",

Nevertheless, this strength is valid only in the case when the market is consolidated, therefore, the strategic goal of the community is to avoid splitting the EU’s market into individual member states considering both the economic and political aspects, the force of which is considerably more reduced. This paper aims to comprehensively analyze the energy market of the European Union and determine the key weaknesses which threaten the community’s security in this area. At the same time, it is presupposed to identify the key initiatives through which the European Union aspires to consolidate the energy market’s integrity in the conditions of growing international competition and changing geopolitical environment. To reach these specific goals, a subset of objectives which are expected to be achieved by applying both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies has been selected. The results reached show that the European Union’s efforts are insufficient to consolidate the energy market and deepen the integration, nevertheless, the proposed plans are promising, offering the community a favorable perspective.},

Such policies lead to a decreasing diversity and expose the system vulnerability for future disruptions. Given recent developments, another gas supply crisis like 2009 might have a different impact. In this study, we investigate the robustness of the current EU gas infrastructure to withstand potential disruptions. We used a network simulation model to simulate the demand and supply balance of the European gas market. The study includes a climatic feature of the gas hubs, potential consumption profile changes, and supply competition with the East Asian market. Our result suggests that the European gas market is not as sensitive as it has in the 2009 crisis despite these challenges. Increasing pipeline connections and new LNG terminals built after 2009 provide spare capacity as the demand growth is slower than expected due to mild winters in recent years. Furthermore, abundant LNG suppliers offer more options to mitigate the price effect and to avoid demand curtailment."

  abstract = {A growing scholarship argues that decarbonization cannot be achieved with single instruments like carbon pricing alone. A broader mix of reinforcing policies is required. This literature focuses on how policies can accelerate technological innovation, restrict polluting activities, promote green growth, and ensure social justice. Applying the policy mix literature to the European Union (EU), this article examines the development of climate and energy policies from separate and narrow initiatives to coordinated policy packages to achieve increasingly ambitious climate targets, culminating with the European Green Deal. The starting point to explain this policy development is that EU policies will reflect the positions of the ‘least ambitious’ actors when unanimity is required. Examination of different policy phases shows that EU policy mixes are not only needed to fulfil different transition functions--they also provide opportunities to combine different actor interests to raise climate ambitions. The EU institutions have been instrumental in crafting policy packages that exempt and compensate the least climate-ambitious actors. The Paris Agreement has also provided an enabling context for higher EU ambitions. Looking towards the future, the corona-induced recession has so far mainly been used by the EU as an opportunity to strengthen climate ambitions and the European Green Deal.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper sheds new light on the policy reality of the European Energy Union on the example of the EU natural gas market. The paper argues that, as the energy union preserves the treaty-based parallelism between the competences of the EU and the member states, the resolution of conflicts between individual preferences and shared priorities has emerged as a measure of consolidation in the EU energy domain. Which logic prevails: the common good or the consensus will? The paper applies the concept of international society to test key hypotheses related to the pluralism/solidarism nexus in the European Energy Union. The paper concludes that individual interests and collective decision-making in the EU natural gas market are reconciled along the premises of pragmatic solidarism with demonstration effects for the regional energy system, indicative of the EU's vanguard role as a regional regulator setting the rules of energy investment and trade in Europe.},

  abstract = {Future energy systems are reliant on the expansion and management of low-carbon technologies in order to reach climate goals. Impact studies of high-penetration intermittent renewable energy sources and electric vehicle (EV) integration in the distribution networks have demonstrated voltage violation and congestion issues. The role of a clustered coordination of distributed energy resources (DER) with a focus on aggregators is presented in terms of legal and techno-economic aspects. The latest European framework assigns aggregators a fundamental role in energy market liberalisation and DER integration towards carbon–neutral energy systems. Aggregator energy management strategies are examined for different DER scenarios, and analysed in the context of the actual situation of aggregators in Europe. The investigation aims to clearly depict how the new European policies of 2019 envision the future electricity network, in order to reevaluate the role of aggregators taking into account implemented concepts in the current market situation, and the status of aggregator research since 2015 up to date.},

abstract="Moscow's international assertiveness in the post-Soviet region, which included the invasion and dismembering of Georgia in 2008, and an entry ``in force'' in Eastern Ukraine and the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, made for a major shift in the relation between Russia and the West, particularly with both the EU and NATO---with many Western states enforcing sanctions in a coordinated manner. That shift was likewise felt in the Western Balkans, a region which, in spite of having a different strategic interest to Russia in comparison with its near abroad territories, has again become geopolitically relevant to the Kremlin's interests. Russia's presence and influence in the region has increased and is driven by two main goals: to drive away the Western Balkans countries from an apparently inevitable accession to the EU and NATO (the only exception here being perhaps Serbia) and simultaneously protect its energy interests in the region and in Europe. To achieve these goals and, therefore, influence the region, the Kremlin is making use of several instruments of ``smart power'', which includes different actors (States, NGOs, Public and Private Companies) and different courses of action. Russian instruments of power have proved to be quite effective in the Western Balkans, by keeping Russia in the orbit of a rather disputed region and traditionally a source of tensions between European regional powers and the Americans, at a very low political and economic cost, the region being a stage of confrontation and accommodation between Moscow and the West, particularly with the EU.",
